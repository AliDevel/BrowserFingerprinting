\section{Motivation and Background}

Hybrid applications.
Hybrid applications are combination of native and web technologies. They allow web content run on their custom browsers. They use webview to run web content. By itself Webviews restricted by  a browser sandbox with very limited access to the native APIs of the mobile devices. But by creating JavaScriptInterfaces they can get acces to native apis. 
The difference of hybrid applications from native are crossplatform and cost effective. Populare frameworks are Cordova, Phonegap and Flutter. With the help of development tools browsers in hybrid applications can be customized. This can open new privacy issues in browser fingerprinting.  \\
