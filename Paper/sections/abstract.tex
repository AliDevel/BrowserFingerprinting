Nowadays, most android applications embed web pages in WebViews, or the whole of the application can be built in WebViews. This method helps to create ones and run them on all platforms. Several frameworks already exist to help create hybrid apps. The security and privacy vulnerabilities of hybrid apps are much higher than those of native apps. They include security and privacy vulnerabilities inherited from the programming language in which they are written, as well as vulnerabilities that browsers pass on.  \\
 To our best knowledge, no general analysis of browser fingerprinting has previously been performed on hybrid applications. Initially, the analysis was done manually on popular hybrid apps such as Instagram, Facebook, Alibaba. We then automatically downloaded and tested 20,000 apps from AndroZoo database, from them  7543 were hybrid apps. We mainly focused on sensitive data leakage  respect to  browser fingerprinting. Most of our research focused on user-agent strings since we found them to be more interesting for browser fingerprints.
